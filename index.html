            <li>
                <h3>Feasibility Assessment</h3>

                <h3>Gathering Requirements Call</h3>

            <li>
                <h3>User Testing + Deployment</h3>
                <p>Before deployment, we organize a user testing session in a controlled environment. This ensures that the solution works as expected and any issues are addressed. Once testing is successful, we proceed with deployment.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Maintenance + Continuous Improvements</h3>
